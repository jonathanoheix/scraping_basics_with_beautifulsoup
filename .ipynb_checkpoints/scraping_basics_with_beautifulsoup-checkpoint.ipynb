    "As a data scientist, I often find myself looking for external data sources that could be relevant for my machine learning projects. The problem is that it is uncommon to find open source data sets that perfectly correspond to what you are looking for, or free APIs that give you access to data. In this case, web scraping can be one solution to get more data. "

    "#### What is web scraping?\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping consists in gathering data available on websites. This can be done manually by a human user or by a bot. The latter can of course gather data much faster than a human user and that is why we are going to focus on this. Is it therefore technically possible to collect all the data of a website in a matter of minutes this kind of bot. The legality of this practice is not well defined however. Websites usually describe in their terms of use and in their robots.txt file if they allow scrapers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scrapers gather website data in the same way a human would do it: the scraper goes onto a web page of the website, gets the relevant data, and move forward to the next web page. Every website has a different structure, that is why web scrapers are usually built to explore one website. The two important issues that arise during the implementation of a web scraper are the following:\n",
    "- What is the structure of the web pages that contain relevant data?\n",
    "- How can we get to those web pages?\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer those questions, we need to understand a little how websites work. Websites are created using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), along with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript. HTML elements are separated by tags and they directly introduce content to the web page. Here is what a basic HTML document looks like:"

On a real website, we need to find out between which tags the relevant data is and tell it to our scraper. We also need to specify which links should be explored and where they can be found among the HTML file. With all this information, our scraper should be able to gather the required data."
